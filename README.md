# OpenGL Game Test
My test on making a actual game with C++ and modern OpenGL.

The game test supports texture renderering (COMING SOON) and also solid color renderering

## Front End
Games are made in the style of Unity.
```
#include "Game.h"

void Game::Start()
{
  // gets called once
}

void Game::Update()
{
  // gets called every frame
}
```
