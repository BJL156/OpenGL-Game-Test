# OpenGL Game Test
My test on making a actual game with C++ and modern OpenGL.

The game test supports texture renderering (COMING SOON) and also solid color renderering

## Front End
Games are made in the style of Unity.
`Game.cpp`
```
#include "Game.h"

namespace OpenGL2DEngine
{
	// gets called once at the start of the game loop
	void Game::Start()
	{

	}

	// gets called every frame
	void Game::Update()
	{

	}
}
```
